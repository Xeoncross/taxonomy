## MicroMVC Taxonomy

This is a MicroMVC module that allows other modules to use a ORM-based tagging system that works with multiple objects.

By extending the taxonomy model with your own models you can add easily add tagging features to those objects. This will allow you to tag posts, videos, users, and anything else you want while using a N3F table structure that is tied to a single tag table through multiple relations tables (one for each object type such as "posts").

Tiny code, yet full tagging support. Requires the [Database](http://github.com/Xeoncross/database) module.
